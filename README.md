# Avtomatic.AI

**AI document assistant that keeps your data on your own infrastructure.**

Avtomatic.AI ingests PDF documents, extracts their text, and analyzes them with a
local LLM — classifying the document, detecting its language, and pulling out
structured entities. The AI runs **on-premise via Ollama**, so document contents
never leave the client's infrastructure.

🔗 **Live demo:** https://avtomatic-ai.vercel.app

## Why

Regulated Swiss SMEs — **fiduciaries (Treuhänder), law firms, and HR teams** —
handle highly confidential documents (invoices, contracts, CVs, certificates) and
are wary of sending them to third-party AI clouds.

Avtomatic.AI's core promise: **data never leaves the client's infrastructure.**
Analysis is performed by a local model (Ollama / `llama3.2`). The cloud deployment
runs with AI disabled (`AI_PROVIDER=none`) and gracefully skips analysis, so the
hosted demo never ships document text to an external provider.

## Architecture

### Document pipeline

```
upload → store (Supabase) → extractText (unpdf) → analyzeWithAI (Ollama) → persist → UI
```

`DocumentService.process()` runs the full pipeline and tracks status
(`UPLOADED → PROCESSING → READY | ERROR`):

1. **`extractText()`** — fetches the PDF from storage and extracts text with `unpdf`.
2. **`analyzeWithAI()`** — sends the text to the configured AI provider, validates
   the response with Zod, and persists the result. Skipped when no provider is
   configured or the text is shorter than 50 characters.

### AI provider abstraction

The AI layer is provider-agnostic behind a single interface:

```ts
interface AIProvider {
  analyzeDocument(input: { text: string; filename: string }): Promise<DocumentAnalysis>;
}
```

```
src/lib/ai/
├── types.ts     # DocumentAnalysisSchema (Zod) + AIProvider interface
├── ollama.ts    # OllamaProvider — local llama3.2
└── index.ts     # getAIProvider() factory (AI_PROVIDER switch)
```

`getAIProvider()` returns the configured provider, or `null` when
`AI_PROVIDER` is unset or `none` (the Vercel default) so analysis is skipped
safely. Future providers — **`ClaudeProvider`**, **`OpenAIProvider`** — plug in
by implementing `AIProvider` and registering in the factory.

The analysis result is validated against a strict schema:

```ts
const DocumentAnalysisSchema = z.object({
  documentType: z.enum(["invoice", "contract", "cv", "certificate", "other"]),
  language: z.enum(["it", "de", "en", "fr", "ru", "other"]),
  confidence: z.number().min(0).max(1),
  summary: z.string(),
  entities: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()),
});
```

### Pluggable storage

`src/lib/storage/` exposes a `StorageProvider` interface with three
implementations selected via `STORAGE_PROVIDER`: `supabase` (default in use),
`local`, and `r2` (Cloudflare R2).

### Security & privacy

- **Signed URLs** — files are read through short-lived signed URLs
  (`StorageProvider.getSignedUrl`) instead of permanent public links. The
  document API returns a fresh 1-hour URL; server-side extraction signs for 120s.
- **Upload hardening** — PDF-only, 15 MB limit, and filenames sanitized into
  path-safe storage keys (`buildStorageKey`).
- The Supabase bucket is **private** and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set
  (server-only) so signing works against it — the public object path is blocked,
  files are reachable only via signed URLs.
- **Password gate** — a `proxy.ts` (Next 16's renamed middleware) protects the
  whole site behind a single shared password (`DEMO_PASSWORD`). Unauthenticated
  requests redirect to `/login` (a localized form with a custom empty-field
  popup); a correct password sets a 30-day `demo-auth` cookie. Disabled
  automatically when `DEMO_PASSWORD` is unset.

### Internationalization (i18n)

The UI ships in **5 languages** — English, Italian, German, French, Russian —
switchable instantly via the language picker in the nav (choice persisted in
`localStorage`). `src/i18n/` holds one dictionary per locale; `en.ts` is the
source of truth and every other locale is typed as `Record<MessageKey, string>`,
so **TypeScript fails the build if any translation key is missing** — keeping all
languages structurally in sync. A client `I18nProvider` exposes `t(key)`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22** (`.nvmrc` provided — `nvm use` / `fnm use`)
- A **Neon** PostgreSQL database
- A **Supabase** project with a storage bucket
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** running locally with the model pulled:
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3.2
  ```

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (runs prisma generate via postinstall)
npm install

# 2. Configure environment (see below), then push the schema
npx prisma db push

# 3. Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/demo.

### Environment variables

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
# Database (Neon)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Storage
STORAGE_PROVIDER="supabase"        # supabase | local | r2
SUPABASE_URL="https://xxxx.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..."
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="..."   # server-only; required for signed URLs on a private bucket
SUPABASE_BUCKET="avtomatic-ai"

# Access gate (optional — when unset the whole site is open)
DEMO_PASSWORD="change-me"

# AI (local only — leave unset/none in the cloud)
AI_PROVIDER="ollama"               # ollama | none
OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"
OLLAMA_MODEL="llama3.2"             # swap to llama3.1:8b (or any model) for more accurate language detection — no code changes
```

> The AI model is read from `OLLAMA_MODEL` in `ollama.ts`, so it can be swapped
> (e.g. to `llama3.1:8b`) for better quality — including more accurate document
> language detection — without touching the code.

> **On Vercel**, leave `AI_PROVIDER` unset (or `none`). The pipeline still
> extracts text and reaches `READY`; AI analysis is skipped because `localhost`
> Ollama is unreachable from the cloud.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |

---

## Roadmap

- ✅ **Auto status updates** — background processing + live polling (done).
- ✅ **Private storage** — private Supabase bucket + signed URLs (done).
- ✅ **Access gate** — shared-password site protection via `proxy.ts` (done).
- ✅ **Chat over documents** — local Ollama Q&A over the extracted content (done).
- **Authentication** — per-user accounts and documents (the gate is shared).
- **Cloud AI providers** — `ClaudeProvider` / `OpenAIProvider` for clients who
  opt into hosted analysis (would also enable chat in the cloud).
- **More document types & richer entity extraction.**
